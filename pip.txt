If you install with pip, you'll want a recent python >=3.13

## Compile you own python

If you compile your own python, you want the bz2 stdlib pacakge. So
make sure you have the bz2 dev package available. On debian:

```
$ mkdir ~/prgs; cd ~/prgs
$ sudo apt install build-essential libssl-dev zlib1g-dev libbz2-dev libreadline-dev libsqlite3-dev wget curl llvm libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev xz-utils tk-dev libffi-dev liblzma-dev python3-openssl git # to install dependencies
$ wget https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.13.3/Python-3.13.3.tgz
$ tar -xvf Python-3.13.3.tgz 
$ cd Python-3.13.3/
$ ./configure --enable-optimizations --prefix=/opt/python-3.13.3
$ make -j 12
$ sudo make install
```

that will install python 3.13 in `/opt/python-3.13.3`

## Dependencies

also, you need pkg-config setup to compile cairo things. In debian
`apt install librust-pangocairo-dev` did the trick. But that's
probably overkill. I am guessing that `libcairo2-dev
libpangocairo-1.0-0` is all you actually need.

# actually install manim

`pip install IPython manim`
