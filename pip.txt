if you install with pip, you'll want a recent python >=3.13

If you compile your own python, you want the bz2 stdlib pacakge. So
make sure you have the bz2 dev package available. On debian: `apt
install libbz2-dev libsqlite3-dev`

also, you need pkg-config setup to compile cairo things. In debian
`apt install librust-pangocairo-dev` did the trick. But that's
probably overkill. I am guessing that `libcairo2-dev
libpangocairo-1.0-0` is all you actually need.

`pip install IPython manim`
