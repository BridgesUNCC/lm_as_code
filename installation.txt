1. Install UV (package manager)
	Windows: powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
	Mac/Linux: curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

2. download and install Latex: https://miktex.org/download only need to run the installation, manim handles the rest.

3. cd into parent folder of the lm_as_code repo (for me it is GitHub/lm_as_code, so I cd into GitHub) and type 'uv init lm_as_code'. This adds the necessary files from UV to be able to add manim. 
4. cd into lm_as_code, and type: 'uv add manim' and 'uv add IPython'. This adds the necessary manim and Ipython packages.

To run the BFS interactive Animation type: uv run manim Templates/GraphTemplate.py BFSAnim -p --renderer=opengl
(the interactive mode might be set to keyboard, feel free to change to mouse)
